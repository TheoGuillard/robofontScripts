### Etch-A-Sketch
Script to help with sketching

**Needs [DrawBot module](https://github.com/typemytype/drawBotRoboFontExtension) installed, but doesn't need to be run in DrawBot Extension.**

- Adjustable x-height (in inches)
- Ascender & descender guides (matches font metrics, or RF defaults if no font is open)
- [Non-photo blue lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-photo_blue) (for scanning â€” but not sure how useful
- Grayed-out letters (to simulate trace paper)

Type some glyphs, print a sheet (or save a PDF), and sketch:
